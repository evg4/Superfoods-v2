        <h2>What are superfoods?</h2>
        <p>
          Superfoods are foods, or sometimes drinks, that are highly nutritious.
          They are a good source of important things like protein, fibre, iron,
          copper, magnesium or antioxidants. They may also contain lots of
          vitamins and minerals and in general promote good health.
        </p>
        <h2>Why are they controversial?</h2>
        <p>
          There is no formal definition of superfoods, which means it can be
          misleading and people may be fooled into thinking one superfood will
          counteract a predominantly bad diet.

        <h2>Kale</h2>
        <p>
          Kale is a leafy, green vegetable rich in nutrients. It's tasty in
          savoury dishes but also a great addition to smoothies! It's in the
          same family as cabbage and Brussel sprouts.

        <h2>Blueberries</h2>
        <p>
          Many berries can be classed as superfoods. An advantage is that they
          can be bought fresh or frozen, so you don't have to plan ahead too
          much when shopping and cooking. Blueberries are great on their own as
          a snack; with yoghurt and honey; or even in a dessert like crumble or
          pie.

        <h2>Almonds</h2>
        <p>
          Almonds and other nuts are a great alternative to a packet of crisps
          if you need a snack. They contain loads of fibre, as well as vitamins
          and antioxidants. They taste great with a square or two of dark
          chocolate!

        <h1>Remember!</h1>
        <p>
          You should aim for at least 5 portions of fruit and veg per day - but
          the more the better!
